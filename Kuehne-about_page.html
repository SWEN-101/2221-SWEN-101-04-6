                <p>
                    Semesterly Text became the one idea that willed itself into fruition once five college students came together and understood how tedious and expensive aquiring specififc textbooks for classes were. Our goal was to make college for students an easier task, since we knew what kinds of stress and struggles students faced daily. Fortunately, that goal has became a reality here at Semesterly Text. The service we provide will always be for the academic character, and will never stop trying to support you and others from the mission of learning more.
